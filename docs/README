# Instructions as in
# https://samnicholls.net/2016/06/15/how-to-sphinx-readthedocs/

# Install Sphinx using either pip or conda
pip install Sphinx

# From the root of Labstep project, initialise docs/ directory with sphinx-quickstart
mkdir docs
cd docs/
sphinx-quickstart

# Answer the questions prompted by sphinx-quickstart.
# Enable the autodoc extension if/when prompted.
# Then, use sphinx-apidoc to build a nice module index.
# Important: set the output directory (-o) to source/ dir to keep the generated Sphinx source files. Without it and by dumping everything into docs/ dir, the py-modindex.html file would not be generated and cause a 404 error on the website.
# It should point to the Python package, ie. ../labstep.
sphinx-apidoc -o source/ ../labstep

# During the build, if warning encountered: "WARNING: autodoc: failed to import module", uncomment this line in conf.py
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))
# And add this if warning persists.
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../'))

# To build the documentation, run the following commands in docs/ dir.
# It is usually good practice to run make clean before make html to ensure that the html output is generated from scratch.
# Or run the script build_documentation.sh
make clean
make html
